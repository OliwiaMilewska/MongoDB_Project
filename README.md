# MongoDB College Project

Welcome to my college project, where I am taking on the challenge of designing and implementing a MongoDB database system. As you explore my repository, you will find all of the necessary files to create an identical database.

*1. Seeders files*

One set of files you will come across is called seeders. These are the files that will be utilized to seed your database with all of the necessary information. 

*2. Validation*

Additionally, I have taken great care in creating validation rules for my data. These rules are defined in a JSON schema and ensure that my data remains consistent.

*3. Views*
To use views type in console "db.NameOfView.find()" in Compass.

income_by_category - shows total income by each product category.

income_by_month - shows total income by month.

total_sum_of_orders - shows total income by all orderes in collection "History" and orders in collection "Orders".

*4. Scripts*
Each script is described inside a file.

To use scripts you need to install mongoDB shell. you can find it here -> https://www.mongodb.com/try/download/shell 

Open cmd. To run script you need to **cd** to folder "./MongoDb_Project/Scripts". Then type "mongosh nameOfScript.js".
