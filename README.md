# MongoDB College Project

Welcome to my college project, where I am taking on the challenge of designing and implementing a MongoDB database system. As you explore my repository, you will find all of the necessary files to create an identical database.

*1. Seeders files*

One set of files you will come across is called seeders. These are the files that will be utilized to seed your database with all of the necessary information. 

*2. Validation*

Additionally, I have taken great care in creating validation rules for my data. These rules are defined in a JSON schema and ensure that my data remains consistent.

*3. Views*
TBD

*4. Scripts*
TBD.
